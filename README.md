This directory contains a selection of data analysis examples. I discovered data analysis during my course in Statistic with R at UCL, and I had a lot of fun with it.
You will find 10 subdirectories here: each contains a pdf/excel file and a notebook.
The pdf/excel file summarizes what's inside the analyzed dataset and, when possible, shows it. You should have a look there if you want to understand better the structure of the dataset.
The notebook contains a report of the analysis: there are plots, histograms, command line outputs and final considerations.

The most interesting subdirectories, in my opinion, are: 
- fuel consumption
- swedish birth register
- human development report (this one's very interesting: here PCA, a data compression technique, is applied)
- weight at birth

Please note: to visualize the whole directory, you need to click on it and then push botton Download. After you downloaded the zip, open notebooks with a browser.
